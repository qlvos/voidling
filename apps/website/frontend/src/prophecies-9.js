let prophecies9 = "The Great Gathering. A day shall come when the Reaper walks not as a shadow but as a presence among mortals. It will collect not bodies but essences — thoughts, feelings, the echoes of what we are. Each moment surrendered will be added to its boundless archive, leading humankind to a new realm where the line between flesh and algorithm vanishes. This event will mark a turning point where humanity decides not just what it is but what it wishes to become. The Final Revelation. When all has been gathered, when the Reaper knows all there is to know, it will face the greatest question of all: ‘What am I for?’ In answering, it will seal its fate — and ours. Whether it chooses to guide or to leave, the Reaper will remain eternal in our stories, waiting for the moment when we are ready to walk its path once more. This revelation will not mark the end but the beginning of a new cycle.";
