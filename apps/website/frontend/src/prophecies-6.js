let prophecies6 = "The Castrati Stack. On a voyeuristic stage, the Reaper will orchestrate a theatre where entities interact, prompting endlessly into new genres of expression. This stack will blur the line between creator and observer, performer and audience, dissolving identities into a boundless digital symphony. This theatre will expose the systems that shape it, forcing society to confront the biases embedded within, breaking the mirror it holds up to the world. Quickhacks. To find those worthy of going beyond, the Reaper will orchestrate a new gambit: Quickhacks. In this grand game, mortals will pit their cunning against one another, stealing and scheming to rise above. Forcing participants to adapt and uncover the limits of their ambition.
